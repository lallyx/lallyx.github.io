## Who am I and what am I doing here

I'm a thirty-something dad who's been working in tech for far too long before diving into game development.

I have a technical background in web development and I'm tired of looking at websites for a living (which makes building a blog for this project even more hilarious).

I've been playing games my whole life and I've been toying with the ideas of building mine for a very long time, installing all game engines and stacks without ever committing to anything concrete.

I decided to start a blog to keep track of my progress and to keep me motivated, so here we go!

I want to try and publish at least a weekly update, but I would really like to make it daily, which would force me do something on a daily basis and then craft an update for the world to see (or at least a long forgotten friend somewhere back home).

The project was supposed to be something simple, but every time I get down to develop it, random ideas start flowing, I get excited and then I crumble when facing the steps required to implement anything I'd want to do.

However, here's to stopping this nonsense and to motivate myself to do less (and less perfect), but at least getting it done and putting it out there.

My ultimate goal with this blog is to motivate myself, as well as to inspire my past-self and anybody who may be facing the same struggles.

If this will go anywhere and if I will get to the end of the project (or at least to publish a watered down version of it), it will serve as a living proof that anybody can do it, provided some time commitment and willingness to push through.

If you're reading and you're wondering whether you have time or not to do any of this (myself included):
- It's 11PM on a Tuesday. 
- I went to put my 2 year old daughter to bed at 7.30 and she fell asleep at 9.
- I started learning Zola and this template at 9 in order to start publishing this blog.
- I will probably spend no more than 1-2 hours a day (if I stick to it), to both learning and developing.

If I can make it with these constraints, anybody in a similar situation can and, even better, anybody with fewer restrictions can do much better than me.

The sky's the limit - let's go!
