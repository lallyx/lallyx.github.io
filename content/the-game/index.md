I love 2d games, pixel-art and everything revolving around these two.

I've grown up with a gameboy stuck in my hands 24/7, so the initial objective was to develop for it.

However, the inherent complexities have put me off for the time being, so I opted to use more modern open-source techonologies to get my feet wet, learn architecture, mindset and workflows and then moving back to the original desire.

To do so, I decided to use **Godot** and to build a **top-down action game**.

I like too many genres to make them all fit, but I want to be able to include a bit of everything in order to pride myself of having built something like my favourites and also to make something I would want to play.

Ideally I'd love my first game to be a big hit and to be jam-packed with features and incredibly fun loops, but realistically I just want to be able to hit publish on Steam and get somebody to at least acknowledge the effort put in.


What I want it to have:
- **An overworld map**: because all good games have one. Super Mario World style.
- **Cute, easily readable characters**: clean pixel art that pops, with vibrant colours
- **Some kind of farming**: I love planting digital seeds and watch them grow
- **Upgrade mechanics**: here's nothing more I love to see in game than progress through an upgradable base with buildings and roaming friends
- **Sailing**: side-scrolling boats, waves and pixel water.
- **Dungeons, dungeons, dungeons**: hand-crafted, no procedural generation. Not too many, but well made.

## My game dev knowledge
*Nothing more than a few random tutorials, long buried in distant memories*

## My pixel-art knowledge
*Nothing more than looking at pokemon sprites in awe and a dream*

## My chip-tune composing knowledge
*Nothing more than pressing buttons on a keyboard and banging a fork on a glass*
